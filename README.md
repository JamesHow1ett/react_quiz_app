Hello, my name is Oleksandr Skorokhod. I'm a front-end developer. There is my React Quiz App. While developing I have used:

 -  React Hooks.

This challenge opened my eyes to these things:

 - Understanding how React Hooks works.

 -  ~~User story: I can see at least 2 types of questions: a city is the capital of.. or a flag belong to country..~~
    Couldn't be implemented, API has already dead.
 -  User story: I can select the question category, difficulty, and the number of questions I should answer.
 -  User story: I can see select an answer
 -  User story: I can see if my answer is correct or incorrect
 -  User story: When I answer correctly, I can move on to the next question
 -  User story: When I answer incorrectly, I can see my results and try again
